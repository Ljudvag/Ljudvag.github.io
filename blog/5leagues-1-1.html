                <i> Day 1 in Alter Erob,
                    <br><br>
                    These dry lands give no illusion of welcome. The horrors that beseige them have left infected and
                    vile looking scars all across the region. My companions are a grim and weary lot, and I do not know
                    whom of them I am to trust, but the promise of wealth should be enough to motivate them for now.
                    <br><br>
                    We came across a rambling old husk of a man whom told us of a haunting presence lurking in the
                    forests to the west.

<i>Day 3 in Alter Erob,
    <br><br>
We reached Hellion's Hope today. The wooden pallisade looked as overgrown as the forest it protects - Or protects against.
<br><br>
The garrison, though few in number, welcomed us to share a meal in the makeshift tavern. Tents and hastily assembled wooden houses speak of a temporary settlement, yet everything about this place feels as if it has stood here since the dawn of time. The temporal dissonance fogs my perception and I hope tomorrow will give more clarity as daybreak drives the dancing shadows away.
