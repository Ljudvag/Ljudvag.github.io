            <h2 class="text-pink">Description</h2>
          <p>Döttskrieg 3000 (DK3K) is a fast-paced skirmish wargame that drops players into the dark and gritty immortality-punk future of 20XX. Each player takes control of one of the many ramshackle Posses roaming the wastelands - gangs of survivors left to fend for themselves on a broken earth. These Posses must rush to complete different open contracts before their adversaries do, by whatever means necessary - usually the violent kind of means.
<br><br>
DK3K uses a poker-inspired action generating system where positioning and control is key to achieving victory. With every single ganger on the battlefield being a stubborn badass and walking paradox, neither side is going to let a trivial thing such as death come in the way. In the world of DK3K, attitude and resilience aren't just traits; they're your primary weapons.
<br><br>
So gather your Posse, fuel up your ride and show the remainder of the world who deserves to sit on the gasoline drenched throne of the wastelands. </p>
